# Open Source Micropolis, based on the original SimCity Classic from Maxis, by Will Wright. #

This is the source code for Micropolis (based on [SimCity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity_(1989_video_game))), released under the GPL. Micropolis is based on the original SimCity from Electronic Arts / Maxis, and designed and written by Will Wright.

The origin of this repo is the "MicropolisCore" directory of the full micropolis repo, https://github.com/SimHacker/micropolis , but it's been stripped down and simplified.

I am now in the process of converting it to build for WebAssembly with emscripten and bind to JavaScript with embind.
